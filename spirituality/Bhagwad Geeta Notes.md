Accept that you don't know things. Surrender to God. Ask him to help you understand situations and possible methods to come out of the situations.

Taking action is the most important part. No one can really help you until you decide to take action - not even God. Be it weight loss, self improvement, learning new things. Take action.

Don't give free advice. If you randomly advise people, they won't follow it. In fact, even we fail to follow our own advice.
