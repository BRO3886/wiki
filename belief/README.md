The chariot is the human body. It's owned and controlled by Krishna (the personality of God). Arjuna is the arrow man (ego, individual personality). Both Krishna and Arjuna are riding in the chariot (body). Arjuna didn't know his closest friend was secretly God until he warbagarbled the cosmos.

You are Arjuna
The spark at the center of your being is Krishna
Your mind is kurukshetra
You and God (Krishna) are inseparable
