# Algorithms and computation


---
### Rough notes
bipartite graph between input and output (binary relation)

general problems, arbitrarily sized inputs

What is an algorithm
a function or procedure that takes inputs and maps it to some output, which needs to be correct for the given input. 

Procedure = sequence of things you have to do

How do you prove it is correct? Induction

What do I need for inductive proof? base case, hypothesis, argue for larger value of set

Efficiency - How fast an algorithm runs? How can we measure that?
Here we dont measure time, instead count fundamental operations

how well does the algorithm peform, not its implementation - kind of an abstract notion o f how well this algorithm does

Model of computation - what computer is allowed to do in a fixed amount of time
