# Sliding Window Median - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-median/description/)

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. There is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the median array for each window in the original array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,5.00000,6.00000]
Explanation: 
Window position                Median
---------------                -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7        1
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       -1
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       -1
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7        3
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7        5
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]       6

```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,2,3,1,4,2], k = 3
Output: [2.00000,3.00000,3.00000,3.00000,2.00000,3.00000,2.00000]
```
