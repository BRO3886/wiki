# Recursion

- The main intuition is to understand that if you can solve a problem for a smaller input, you can solve it for a larger input by using the solution for the smaller input.
- For example, if I know the factorial of 4, I can calculate the factorial of 5 by multiplying 5 with the factorial of 4
- the base case is the smallest input for which you know the answer.
