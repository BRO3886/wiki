    Intuition: Use a sliding window to find longest subarray that can be made all 1s
    by flipping at most k zeros.
    
    The window expands (r pointer) as long as we have used â‰¤ k flips.
    When we exceed k flips, we shrink window from left until we're valid again.
    
    For example: [1,1,0,0,1], k=1
    Window grows: [1] -> [1,1] -> [1,1,0](flip) -> [1,1,0,0](need 2 flips, invalid)
    Shrink left: [1,0,0] -> [0,0] -> [0]
